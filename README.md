# Blockchain, Smart Contracts, and Web3 Assessment Project

This repository is a multi-track assessment project for candidates applying to roles in blockchain engineering, smart contract engineering, and full-stack Web3 development.

It combines:
- a layered Express backend for a simplified blockchain
- a React-based explorer for interacting with the chain
- a Solidity smart contract example for assessment and deployment discussion
- a persistence layer so the chain can survive restarts

---

## What’s Included

### Backend
- Express API with routes for chain, transactions, mining, balance, stats, and wallets
- Blockchain domain model with block hashing, transaction validation, and mining logic
- Persistence layer that saves blockchain state to a JSON file
- Centralized middleware for error handling, logging, validation, and rate limiting

### Frontend
- React dashboard to view blockchain state and mine blocks
- Wallet creation panel for generating key material and checking balances
- Transaction form for creating new pending transactions
- Polling-based refresh for near-real-time updates

### Smart Contracts
- Solidity contract example in [contracts/AssessmentToken.sol](contracts/AssessmentToken.sol)
- Deployment script in [scripts/deploy-contract.js](scripts/deploy-contract.js)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm

### Install

```bash
npm install
```

### Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

If you do not have an .env.example file yet, create one with values such as:

```env
PORT=3002
NODE_ENV=development
BLOCKCHAIN_DIFFICULTY=2
BLOCKCHAIN_MINING_REWARD=100
INITIAL_MINER_ADDRESS=genesis-miner
SEED_DEMO_DATA=true
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3002
```

### Run the app

```bash
# Terminal 1
npm start

# Terminal 2
npm run dev
```

The React app uses the proxy in [src/setupProxy.js](src/setupProxy.js) so browser requests to /api are forwarded to the backend.

---

## API Overview

All API responses follow this pattern:

```json
{ "success": true, "message": "...", ... }
```

### Core endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | /api/chain | Return the full blockchain |
| GET | /api/chain/valid | Return whether the chain is valid |
| POST | /api/transactions | Add a pending transaction |
| GET | /api/transactions/pending | View pending transactions |
| POST | /api/mine | Mine the pending transactions |
| GET | /api/balance/:address | Get an address balance |
| GET | /api/stats | View chain and mining statistics |
| POST | /api/wallets | Generate a wallet-like key pair |
| GET | /api/wallets/:address | View a balance for a wallet address |

## Smart Contract Notes

The Solidity contract in [contracts/AssessmentToken.sol](contracts/AssessmentToken.sol) is a simple ERC-20-style token example. It demonstrates:
- token supply initialization
- balance tracking
- transfer and approval flows
- basic events

It is intended as an assessment artifact and can be extended for more advanced scenarios.

---

## Testing

Backend unit and HTTP integration tests live in [tests/](tests). Smart contract tests live in
[test/AssessmentToken.test.js](test/AssessmentToken.test.js) and run under Hardhat/Mocha, so the
two suites are run separately.

Run:

```bash
npm test              # backend: unit + http integration tests
npm run test:contracts   # smart contract tests
```

## Design Decisions & Trade-offs

### Signing curve: P-256 instead of secp256k1

Wallets and transaction signatures use the **P-256** elliptic curve, not the `secp256k1` curve
used by Bitcoin/Ethereum. This is deliberate: wallet key generation and transaction signing
happen entirely **client-side** in the browser via the native Web Crypto API
([src/utils/wallet.js](src/utils/wallet.js)), so the private key never leaves the browser or
touches the server. Web Crypto's ECDSA implementation only supports P-256/P-384/P-521 — no
browser supports `secp256k1` natively — so P-256 was the only curve that allowed real
client-side signing without pulling in a third-party elliptic-curve library. The backend signs
and verifies with `sha256` digest and `ieee-p1363` signature encoding to match exactly what
`window.crypto.subtle` produces.

### Why a transaction's timestamp must be supplied by the client

A signed transaction's hash includes its `timestamp`. If the server generated its own timestamp
when reconstructing the transaction from the request body, it would never match the timestamp
the client actually signed, and every signature verification would fail. `Transaction` accepts
an explicit `timestamp`, and the API requires one whenever a `signature` is present.

### Balance/double-spend checks are mempool-aware

`addTransaction` rejects a transaction if its amount exceeds the sender's confirmed balance minus
whatever that same address already has pending — otherwise an address could submit multiple
transactions in a row that each individually looked affordable but collectively overspent before
a block was mined.

### `POST /api/wallets` (server-side key generation) is kept for compatibility only

The frontend no longer calls it — `WalletPanel` generates keys in the browser. The endpoint stays
in the backend since removing an existing API contract wasn't asked for, but generating a private
key server-side and returning it over HTTP is not a pattern worth building on.

---

## Known Limitations

- The blockchain is still a simplified educational implementation, not a production-grade distributed ledger.
- There is no authentication/authorization on any endpoint — anyone who can reach the API can mine blocks or check any address's balance.
- The smart contract is intentionally simple for assessment purposes.
